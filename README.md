Hi, I’m @angerhang.

I work at the intersection of wearable sensing and machine learning to build systems that understand human health at scale.

I’m especially interested in:
- Self-supervised learning on large wearable datasets  
- Multimodal representation learning  
- Turning raw sensor streams into meaningful health signals  

I believe the future of healthcare is continuous, personalized, and data-driven.

If you’re building ambitious projects in wearables, mobile health, or large-scale ML — I’d love to collaborate.
