Hi, I’m @angerhang.

I work at the intersection of **wearable sensing and machine learning to build systems that understand human health at scale**.

🌱 I'm currently learning **Hardware and genetics**

Fun facts:
- Built the first movement foundation model for wearables (before Apple and Google).
- Published across sensing, machine learning, medicine, genetics, and ethics.
- Used to journal in English; now writing in Chinese so I don’t lose it.


Intersts:
- Self-supervised learning on large wearable datasets  
- Multimodal representation learning  
- Turning raw sensor streams into meaningful health signals  

I believe the future of healthcare is continuous, personalized, and data-driven.

If you’re building ambitious projects in wearables, mobile health, or large-scale ML — I’d love to collaborate.
